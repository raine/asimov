Every Time Machine snapshot copies your `node_modules`, `.venv`, `target`, `DerivedData`; gigabytes of files you can rebuild with one command. With git worktrees and AI coding agents spinning up parallel copies of every project, that waste compounds fast.

Asimov scans your home directory, finds dependency folders next to their config files, and tells Time Machine to skip them. Install once, run daily, forget it exists.

## Install

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install asimov
brew services start asimov
```

> The homebrew-core formula is updated automatically, usually within a few hours of a release. For the newest version the moment it ships, use the curl installer below.

### curl (latest, no Homebrew)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AsimovMac/asimov/main/scripts/install-remote.sh | bash
```

Installs to `~/.local` (`bin/asimov`, plus its library and data files under `libexec/` and `share/`). Found a bug? [Open an issue](https://github.com/AsimovMac/asimov/issues).

### Quick start

```sh
asimov --dry-run    # preview what would be excluded — changes nothing
asimov              # apply
```

That's it. Asimov then runs itself once a day, every day. Add `--stats` to either command to see sizes and how much space you're saving.

See [other install methods](#other-install-methods) to build from source.

## What you'll see

```
$ asimov --dry-run --stats

⏳ Scanning for dependency directories…
📦 Processing matches…
- Would exclude: ~/Code/myapp/node_modules (412M).
- Would exclude: ~/Code/myapp/.next (89M).
- Would exclude: ~/Code/api/.venv (1.2G).
- Would exclude: ~/Code/rust-cli/target (2.4G).
- Would exclude: ~/Code/worktrees/feature-auth/node_modules (1.6G).
- Would exclude: ~/Code/worktrees/feature-auth/.next (492M).
- Would exclude: ~/Code/worktrees/refactor-billing/node_modules (1.6G).
…

Would exclude 27 directories, totalling 18.4G.
```

`--dry-run` previews without changing anything. Drop the flag — and the `--stats` if you want it fast — to apply.

## How it works

Asimov pairs each dependency directory with a **sentinel** config file. A folder is only excluded if its sentinel exists alongside it:

- `node_modules/` → requires `package.json`
- `vendor/` → requires `composer.json` or `go.mod`
- `target/` → requires `Cargo.toml` or `pom.xml`

This means Asimov never touches a folder that just happens to share a common name. Safe to run anywhere in your home directory.

**Don't see your tool?** You can teach Asimov your own directory + sentinel pairs in a couple of lines — no need to wait for a release. See [Add your own patterns](#add-your-own-patterns).


## What Asimov doesn't do

Asimov sets **Time Machine exclusions** — nothing else. Three things it's often expected to do, and doesn't:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Hide folders from Spotlight** | Spotlight indexing is a separate mechanism. Excluding `node_modules` from Time Machine does not stop it appearing in Spotlight results. Tracked in [#70](https://github.com/AsimovMac/asimov/issues/70) |
| **Shrink existing backups** | An exclusion stops a directory being backed up *from now on*. Copies already on the backup disk stay until you delete them or Time Machine ages them out |
| **Delete anything** | Asimov never removes a file from your Mac. It only sets an attribute on the directory |

Nothing is lost by excluding a dependency directory: it isn't backed up, and after a restore you run `npm install` (or your equivalent) to get it back.

### Verifying it worked

```sh
asimov --dry-run                                                   # what Asimov would exclude
sudo mdfind "com_apple_backup_excludeItem = 'com.apple.backupd'"   # what's actually excluded
```

If `mdfind` doesn't list your projects, the run isn't reaching them. The two usual causes:

- **Projects live outside your home directory.** Add them with [`[scan] extra`](#scan-more-than-your-home-directory).
- **The schedule isn't loaded.** Check with `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.stevegrunwell.asimov`, and see [Schedule](#schedule).


## Usage

```
asimov [--dry-run] [--verbose] [--quiet] [--stats] [--no-read-cache] [--no-write-cache] [--help] [--version] [directory]
asimov prune  [--quiet]
asimov doctor [--quiet]
```


| Option              | Description                                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--dry-run`         | Print what would be excluded without changing Time Machine       |
| `--verbose`         | Show all directories including already-excluded ones             |
| `--quiet`           | Suppress all output except errors                                |
| `--stats`           | Show per-directory sizes and a total-space summary               |
| `--no-read-cache`   | Ignore cached state; re-discover and re-verify everything, then rebuild the cache |
| `--no-write-cache`  | Run normally but don't persist any cache updates                 |

### `asimov prune`

Reports Time Machine exclusions that point at a directory which no longer exists, and compacts Asimov's own cache.

```
$ asimov prune

Stale Time Machine exclusions (1):
  ~/Downloads/old-client  path no longer exists

These are sticky exclusions (tmutil addexclusion -p), which Asimov never sets.
They persist after the directory is deleted. To remove one:

  sudo tmutil removeexclusion -p ~/Downloads/old-client

Asimov cache: 3 stale entries dropped.
```

`prune` is **read-only** with respect to Time Machine — it prints the removal command rather than running it, since these entries are system-wide and Asimov didn't create them. The only file it writes is its own cache.

Worth knowing why the distinction exists: Time Machine has two kinds of exclusion.

| | Where it's stored | Survives deleting the directory? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tmutil addexclusion PATH` — what Asimov uses | An attribute on the directory itself | **No** — removed with it |
| `tmutil addexclusion -p PATH` — "sticky" | Time Machine's system preferences | **Yes** — forever |

So Asimov's own exclusions clean themselves up. Only sticky entries, set by other tools or by hand, can outlive their directory — and nothing else surfaces them.

Asimov keeps a cache under `~/.cache/asimov/` so repeat runs are near-instant. The two flags above control it on independent axes — reading and writing:

- `--no-read-cache` — *"rebuild."* Ignores everything cached, re-scans the filesystem, and re-verifies every directory against Time Machine, then writes a fresh cache. **`--full-scan` is an alias.**
- `--no-write-cache` — *"don't touch state."* Uses the fast cache to read, but persists nothing. Handy with `--dry-run`.
- Both together = a fully stateless run that reads and writes nothing. **`--no-cache` is an alias for this.**


### `asimov doctor`

Checks the install itself rather than your projects. Run it when something seems off, or straight after an upgrade.

```
$ asimov doctor

Asimov doctor

Install
  ✓ asimov 0.10.0 (/opt/homebrew/bin/asimov)
  ✗ typing 'asimov' runs a different binary — this one is shadowed
      /usr/local/bin/asimov  (version 0.3.0)
      Remove the one you don't want, or fix the order of PATH.

Schedule
  ✗ homebrew.mxcl.asimov: its program /opt/homebrew/Cellar/asimov/0.3.0/bin/asimov no longer exists
      launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/homebrew.mxcl.asimov
      rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.asimov.plist

Cache
  ✗ ~/.cache/asimov/excluded is not readable and writable by you (owner: root)
      A run as root left these behind. Clear them:
      rm -rf ~/.cache/asimov

Config
  ✓ ~/.config/asimov/config looks valid

Time Machine
  ✓ tmutil can read exclusions

3 problems found.
```

It covers five things: which `asimov` your shell actually runs, whether a schedule is installed and loaded, whether the cache is readable and writable by you, whether the config parses, and whether `tmutil` can read exclusions at all (it can't without Full Disk Access).

`doctor` is **read-only** — it prints the fix rather than applying it — and it never executes another `asimov` binary it finds, reading versions out of the file instead. It exits `1` if it finds anything, so it's safe to use in a script.

## Schedule

The curl and source installers set up a daily launchd job automatically. To trigger one immediately or stop the schedule:

```sh
launchctl kickstart gui/$(id -u)/com.stevegrunwell.asimov   # run now
launchctl bootout   gui/$(id -u)/com.stevegrunwell.asimov   # stop schedule
```

## Configuration

Asimov works out of the box. To customize it, drop a config file at `~/.config/asimov/config`. The most useful thing you can do here is **teach it dependency directories of your own.**

### Scan more than your home directory

By default Asimov scans your home directory. Keep projects elsewhere too — say under `/private/var/www`? Add each extra root under a `[scan]` section and it's scanned on every run, alongside home:

```ini
[scan]
extra = /private/var/www         # one "extra =" line per directory
extra = /Volumes/Work/clients    # ~ is expanded, e.g. extra = ~/Sites
```

Your home directory is always scanned; these are added to it. Configured directories that don't exist (an unmounted volume, say) are skipped with a warning instead of failing the run. Passing a directory on the command line (`asimov /some/path`) still overrides everything and scans only that path.

Only keep projects under a subset of home — say `~/Code` — and don't want the rest of home scanned at all? Use `dirs` instead of `extra`. It's an exhaustive list: home is scanned only if you list it.

```ini
[scan]
dirs = ~/Code                    # one "dirs =" line per directory; home is NOT implied
dirs = /Volumes/Work/clients      # add as many roots as you need
```

`dirs` and `extra` answer different questions, so don't mix them — if both are set, `dirs` wins and `extra` is ignored with a warning. If every listed directory turns out to be missing, Asimov exits with an error rather than silently scanning nothing.

### Add your own patterns

Using a tool Asimov doesn't know about yet? Add it yourself. Each pattern is a `directory sentinel` pair — exactly the same mechanism the [built-ins](#how-it-works) use: the directory is excluded **only** when the sentinel file sits right beside it, so it's safe even for common folder names.

```ini
[sentinels]
extra = .cache my-tool.toml      # exclude .cache only when my-tool.toml is its sibling
extra = generated codegen.yml    # one "extra =" line per pattern
extra = dist *.podspec           # glob sentinels work too
```

Want to turn a built-in off? List its exact pair under `disabled`:

```ini
[sentinels]
disabled = vendor Gemfile        # stop excluding Ruby's vendor/ directories
```

### Global caches (opt-in)

Global tool caches in your home directory (`~/.cache`, `~/.gradle/caches`, …) are left alone by default. Opt in, and add paths of your own:

```ini
[fixed_dirs]
enabled = true                   # exclude the built-in global caches
extra   = ~/my-build-cache       # plus any paths you name (always excluded when they exist)
extra   = ~/golang/pkg/mod       # e.g. a Go module cache under a custom GOPATH
```

### Skip parts of your home directory

Asimov never descends into `~/.Trash` or `~/Library`. Add directories of your own under `[skip_paths]` and they're left alone too - not searched, never excluded:

```ini
[skip_paths]
extra = ~/Music                  # one "extra =" line per directory
extra = ~/Pictures
```

This only narrows the *search*. Global caches you opted into under `[fixed_dirs]` are still excluded, even inside a skipped path.

If all your code lives in one folder, scanning just that folder (`asimov ~/Code`, see [usage](#usage)) is usually simpler than skipping everything else.

## Credits

Asimov was created by **[Steve Grunwell](https://github.com/stevegrunwell)**, who built and maintained it at `stevegrunwell/asimov` from 2018 through v0.3.0 — the version most people know it by. Thank you, Steve, for the years of work and for [handing it on](https://github.com/AsimovMac/asimov/issues/99) so carefully.

The project now lives at [`AsimovMac/asimov`](https://github.com/AsimovMac/asimov) (the original repo, transferred — the old URL still redirects here), maintained by [@django23](https://github.com/django23). Releases from `v0.4.0` onward add expanded ecosystem coverage, a config file, and the caching that took typical runs from ~75s to ~1–2s.

Built on the contributions of everyone who filed issues and PRs over the years. Asimov is, and stays, MIT-licensed and community-driven.
